## General info

This program is just a simple calculator supporting four basic operations and order of operations.

## Implementation ideas

My main goal was to create a simple calculator in order to learn and practice creating desktop application using WPF

## Technologies

The application was written in C# using MVVM design pattern with WPF .NET Core for GUI.

Style of the window was achived using MahApps.Metro framework.

## Status

Since this project was only a practice I consider it to be finisned and will probably not work on it anymore.
